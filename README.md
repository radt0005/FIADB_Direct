This repository is designed to allow a user to build a local copy of FIADB in PostgreSQL. Can be used for a single state or for the entire FIADB.

### How do I get set up? ###

Almost everything is run via R. Assumes destination computer already has PostgreSQL installed. The creation of the database is set up to work on Linux. Other platforms will need an alternate method.

### Who do I talk to? ###
