comment on column FS_FIADB.OZONE_BIOSITE_SUMMARY.field_id
  is 'the 7-digit number used by the field crew for all current and active biosites';
comment on column FS_FIADB.OZONE_BIOSITE_SUMMARY.location_cnt
  is 'If location count = 1, then the plant injury data is collected from a single location. If location count = 2, then the plant injury data is collected from two or more locations with the same 7-digit hex number (P3HEX). Two locations are selected as needed to obtain optimal species and plant counts for each biosite. The injury data and plant counts from both locations are combined in the formulation of the biosite index.';
comment on column FS_FIADB.OZONE_BIOSITE_SUMMARY.ground_loc_cd
  is 'GROUND_LOC_CD = 1 means the GPS values stayed the same from one year to the next.  GROUND_LOC_CD = 2 means the biosite has been moved more than 3 miles and has a second set of GPS values.  GROUND_LOC_CD = 3 means the biosite has moved more than 3 miles for a third time and has a third set of GPS values.';
comment on column FS_FIADB.OZONE_BIOSITE_SUMMARY.plant_inj_cnt
  is 'The number of injured plants at a biosite (P3Hex) equals the number of plants that have injury amounts greater than zero.plant_inj_cnt = count ( plants at a hexagon that have an injury amount greater than zero )';

comment on column FS_FIADB.OZONE_BIOSITE_SUMMARY.plant_ratio

comment on column FS_FIADB.OZONE_BIOSITE_SUMMARY.biosite_index_multiplier
  is 'The biosite index (BI) is formulated from the injury amount and severity ratings recorded for each plant and the numbers of plants and species evaluated at each biosite.  BI values are classified into categories of ozone risk designed to capture differences in plant damage to ozone sensitive species in areas of low, moderate, and high ozone exposure. The biosite index multiplier is the BI multiplied by 1000 to allow the ozone risk categories to be defined by integers. 	biosite_index_multiplier = biosite_index * (1000)';

comment on column FS_FIADB.OZONE_BIOSITE_SUMMARY.svrty_class_one
  is 'The percent of all evaluated plants at a given biosite that have 1 to 6 percent injury.

  is 'The percent of all evaluated plants at a given biosite that have 7 to 25 percent injury.
